Our game is fun, functions well, and honestly is a little bit addicting. Cars come 10% faster each level, and your score per level is linked to a timer based on how fast you get across the road. 

We used CSS3 key frames to animate multple aspects of our header. On page-load, the header slides nicely into place, and then while you're playing, the stop sign cycles through many colors. We also used CSS to create our instructions that appear when your over your mouse over the "display instructions" text.

One of the toughest things to deal with was using the same car images while facing them different directions. The canvas has a rotate function that rotates the entire canvas, and you can do that, draw the image, and then un-rotate the canvas, but even then it had really weird effects on the vehicle locations and movements. After spending way too long on this, we decided to just copy the images and rotate them before hand, meaning we have to load 6 more photos than we otherwise would have, but they're all small photos.
